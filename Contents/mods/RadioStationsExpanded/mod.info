description=Expands the PZ Radio, cause even tho we don't have NPC's, it'd be cool to find stuff and stories about people.

This is still a work in progress so  give it a try and report all bugs, I promise to take a look at them whenever I can

SPOILERS: [spoiler]My mod relies completely on immersion and first time experiences (this is because I haven’t had many events as I planned and wished I could, initially). But as you’re not the only one asking for ‘the purpose’ of it. Let’s say: This mod triggers events all over KY map, as for now, they’re more focused on Rosewood, Muldraugh and Fallas Lake, while still mixing simple stories of people that were using a common simplex radio frequency. These events will have loot (not as much as you wished for lmao), dead bodies (some will reanimate, some won’t, and you’ll know why if you come across the radio broadcast), etc. [/spoiler]

If you find it interesting, and want to help, reach me out!
