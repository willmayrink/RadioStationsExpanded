# Radio Stations Expanded 📡🧟

A Project Zomboid mod adding a dynamic survivor radio channel ("KY Simplex Calling" at 88.0 MHz) with 21 unique broadcasts. 80% are atmospheric tales from Knox County's fall; 20% are loot hints triggering on-site spawns (items, corpses). Messages play without repeats in a playthrough, with a 5% daily chance in the 8-11 AM window. Built for Build 42.

## Features
- **Dynamic Channel**: Tune to 88.0 MHz for lore-rich survivor stories and hints (e.g., Rosewood PD guns, Muldraugh meds).
- **Non-Repeating**: ModData tracks played messages—fresh per save, resets on new games.
- **Loot Spawns**: Hints drop items/zombies at map coords.
- **Immersion**: Multi-line static/dialogue; daily morning airs for tension.

## Installation
1. Download from [Releases](https://github.com/willmayrink/RadioStationsExpanded/releases).
2. Extract to `Zomboid/mods/`.
3. Enable in mod menu.
4. Start/load a game; tune a powered radio to 88.0 MHz.

## Usage
- **Play**: Wait for 8-11 AM broadcasts (5% daily chance). Tune in for text.
